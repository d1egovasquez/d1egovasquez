I'm Diego, currently residing in Buenos Aires, however, it's a beautiful city and I'd love to live here, mainly to be closer to everything and have access to some awesome opportunities in the IT field.
I'm a System Engineer and self-taught Web developer, but I break into many different fields and Iâ€™m fairly knowledgeable in most things surrounding SEO, SEM. I like to make websites and portray my clients' desires to produce better results or improve in some way by helping them grow.
